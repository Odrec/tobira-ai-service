Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neurons in the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers - input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Each connection has a weight that adjusts during training through a process called backpropagation. The training process involves feeding the network with labeled data and adjusting the weights to minimize the prediction error. Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. We will also discuss different types of neural networks such as convolutional neural networks for image processing and recurrent neural networks for sequential data. Understanding these concepts is crucial for anyone interested in modern AI development.",
